# Problem 1

``` r
trashwheel_df <- 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data\!

``` r
precip_2018 <- 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 <- 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df <- 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df <- 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) 

month_df <- 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-"month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, including some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include monthly precipitation data. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33. The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

Read and clean NYC subway data.

``` r
nycsubway_df <- 
  read_csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = 
      ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE),
    vending = 
      ifelse(vending == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset has 19 columns and 1868 rows, and includes variables line,
station name, station latitude, station longitude, routes served
(route1-route11), entry, entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance. For
data cleaning, I used the function clean\_names in the janitor package
to make the column names more readable in R, I selected only the columns
for variables that were relevant for this problem, and I used the mutate
function and ifelse function to change the entry column from character
to logical. Since a future question asks about vending, I used the same
method to change the vending column from character to logical. These
data are cleaner than before, but they are not tidy yet. They would be
tidier if we could condense the routes so that we did not have 11
columns for route1 through route11, and instead could have one column
for route number (1-11), and another for route name (A, N, R, etc.).

There are 465 distinct stations, of which 84 are ADA compliant. The
proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow
entrance is 0.3770492.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables:

``` r
nycsubway_df <- 
  mutate(nycsubway_df,
         route8 = 
           as.character(route8),
         route9 =
           as.character(route9),
         route10 = 
           as.character(route10),
         route11 = 
           as.character(route11)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name"
  )
```

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of stations that serve the A
train, 17 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

Read in and clean pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_df <- read_csv(
  "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
    separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = 
      as.integer(month)
  ) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, prez_gop, prez_dem) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    prez_gop:prez_dem,
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "prez_value") %>%
  filter(prez_value == 1) %>% 
  select(-day, -prez_value)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df <- 
  tibble(
    month = 01:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_df <- 
  left_join(pols_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  rename(month = month_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    year =
      as.double(year)
  ) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

Read in and clean snp.csv

``` r
snp_df <- read_csv(
  "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = ) %>% 
  mutate(
      month =
        as.integer(month)
  ) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df <- 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

snp_df <- 
  left_join(snp_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  rename(month = month_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = 
      as.double(year)
  ) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

Read in and clean unemployment.csv

``` r
unemployment_df <- read_csv(
  "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
month_df <- 
  tibble(
    month = month.abb,
    month_name = month.name
  )

unemployment_df <- 
  left_join(unemployment_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  rename(month = month_name) %>% 
  rename(year = Year) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

Join datasets snp, pols, and unemployment.

``` r
fivethirtyeight_df <- 
  left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols\_df dataset included information on how many governors,
senators, and congressional representatives were democrats or
republicans at any given time from 1947 to 2015. The snp\_df dataset
included closing values of the S\&P stock index from 1950 to 2015 for
specific dates of observation during that period. The unemployment\_df
dataset included monthly percentage of unemployment from 1948 to 2015.
The fivethirtyeight\_df dataset includes information from all three
datasets, and has 11 columns and 817 rows. It includes data from 1947 to
2015, although some columns have missing values for some years, because
the original datasets did not have fully-overlapping time frames.The
variables in this dataset include: year, month, number of republican
governors (‘gov\_gop’), number of republican senators (‘sen\_gop’),
number of republican congressional representatives (‘rep\_gop’), number
of democratic governors (‘gov\_dem’), number of democratic senators
(‘sen\_dem’), number of democratic congressional representatives
(‘rep\_dem’), closing value of S\&P stock index (‘close’), and monthly
percentage unemployment (‘unemployment’). The variable ‘close’ in
particular includes the closing value of the S\&P stock index on a
particular date within the month it is associated with, as opposed to an
average closing value for the month or some other value.
